# About Me
## General Info

### At UCSD
I transfered to **UC San Diego** from **SJSU**, and will be graduating Spring '25 with a B.S. in Cognitive Science w/ a specialization in Machine Learning & Neural Computation. I am also double minoring in Computer Science & General Biology. At UCSD I have been a part of multiple organizations including the Men's Ultimate Frisbee Team (known as the "Air Squids"), Triton Neurotech, Triangle Fraternity, and Sun God Archery, Circle K International. One of my biggest accomplishments as been winning second place in the *international NeurotechX* competition with <ins>Triton Neurotech</ins>. 

### Random stuff
I really like running and am currently training to run my second half marathon this June. My goal is to run it in ~~under 2 hours~~ under 1:45. This is frankly an easy goal as I was able to run it in 2hrs and 3 minutes last year, but had enough energy for my last mile to be completed in 5 minutes and 21 seconds. Unfortunately, I injured my knee so I was out for all of fall quarter. Fortunately I made a full recovery by the start of winter quarter and have been able to run more frequently. To quote a random meme on the internet ~~for the sake of being able to check off quoting text~~
> When your mental health is so messed up that you start running again

This is relevant because **I find it quite __funny__ and __love__ self deprecating jokes**. That is the only reason.

I also really like music in general, so I thought I would include pictures of my top five favorite albums:
![Queen Album 1]()
![Queen Album 2]()
![Ten by Pearl Jam](images/Ten.png)
![S&M2 by Metallica](images/S&M2.png)
![Superunkown by Soundgarden](images/superunkown.png)

While it may seem that I mostly listen to metal, rock, and grunge from this list, I also enjoy listening to electronic, pop, and other genres.

### Coding Background
This is probably the most important section for this assignment ~~because I am going to finish quoting code, and the rest of the core markdown constructs~~ because it explains my experience for this class.
